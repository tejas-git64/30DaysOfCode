#### This project uses **eventHandlers** and **css attributes => 'keydown' , 'keyup'**
- Each key gives outputs a sound given for that key according to its **ASCII** value
- Uses HTML's `data-` attribute to play the assigned sound for each keypress.

### The 2nd project of this series!! a clock!
This project uses JS's built in methods like **getMinutes()** and **getSeconds()** to depict the correct time
- Has three needles - hour, minutes and seconds
- Used `cubic-bezier()` to give that ticking effect just like in the original project

Styled like a wall clock üïë at home<br /><br />

### Playing with a few artistic CSS variables
Even here we use HTML's `data-` attribute, to assign units in px
- Uses CSS's pseudo class `:root` to assign custom values from each input i.e range-sliders & color picker
- Uses CSS's EventListeners like `change` & `mousemove` to update new values

### **Day 4: Array Methods-1**

### Brushing up some basic yet intriguing array methods
Here we're going to understand the usage of the following methods:
- `sort()` sorts elements in the ascending or descending order
- `split()` spilts an array/object based on the position assigned, used mainly in destructing objects
- `filter()` creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function
- `reduce()` executes a reducer function for each value in an array and returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result
- `map()` creates a new array from the results of a previously existing function 



### **Day 5: Flexbox Gallery**

### its flexbox time!! one of most important topics in css, especially if you wanna play with images/div elements

### Here we use flexbox to align `p` elements to enlarge and shrink on click and also widen it

</p>

##### These are the main functions used to work with flexbox in this project

- `display: flex` activates flexbox
- `justify-content` aligns the div horizontally
- `align-items` align the div vertically
- `transform` fuction used to create sliding animations of the top and bottom `p` element
- `toggle()` This JS method is used to add and remove the class `open` which enlarges the font size of the middle `p` element
- `includes()` This is another JS methods that returns a boolean value if a string contains a specific character/string 

Flexbox allows seamless wrapping and resizing with the changing width of the page, it can be used along with media queries to build a responsive site for devices of different width
